## Components Required

- Arduino board
- LED matrix display
- Push buttons (for directional control)
- Jumper wires


## Instructions

1. **Connect Hardware**:
   - Connect the LED matrix and buttons to the Arduino board according to the defined pin configurations in the code.

2. **Upload Code**:
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board.

3. **Play the Game**:
   - Once uploaded, the game will start automatically.
   - Use the buttons connected to the Arduino to change the direction of the snake.
   - Try to guide the snake to eat the food displayed on the LED matrix.
